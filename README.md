# nginx-generator #

Easy simple way to create Nginx vhost files for fairly simple sites, such as a proxy to a Node.js server,
a redirect from one domain to another, or simply serving a static site.

## Synopsis ##

To install:

```bash
$ npm install -g nginx-generator
```

To generate a simple redirect from `www.chilts.org` to `chilts.org`, just do:

```bash
$ nginx-generator \
      --name org-chilts-www \
      --domain www.chilts.org \
      --type redirect \
      --var to=chilts.org \
      /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/org-chilts-www
```

Then reload Nginx

```bash
$ sudo service nginx reload
```

Your vars can also be read from a JSON file, such as this:

```bash
$ echo '{"to":"chilts.org"}' > vars.json
$ nginx-generator \
      --name org-chilts-www \
      --domain www.chilts.org \
      --type redirect \
      --data vars.json \
      /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/org-chilts-www
```

To generate a proxy config for `chilts.org` to a server running on `localhost:8000`, do:

```
$ nginx-generator \
      --name org-chilts \
      --domain chilts.org \
      --type proxy \
      --var host=localhost \
      --var port=8000 \
      /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/org-chilts
```

To generate a vhost that will serve a static site:

```
$ nginx-generator \
      --name org-chilts-static \
      --domain static-chilts.org \
      --type static \
      --var dir=/home/chilts/htdocs \
      /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/org-chilts-static
```

## Roadmap ##

* add ability to set and define config for basic auth for any site
* add ability to make a site serve over https with config for certs

## Other Nginx Packages ##

There are some other Nginx packages out there such as:

* https://www.npmjs.org/package/nginx-vhosts
* https://www.npmjs.org/package/ngineer
* https://www.npmjs.org/package/nginx-conf
* https://www.npmjs.org/package/nodeginx

However, I didn't want to control Nginx itself like `nginx-vhosts` and `ngineer` does, especially on Debian or Ubuntu
machines since upstart already does this. All I wanted to do was template in some simple vhosts in a programmatic
(library or CLI program) way. Also, `nginx-conf` is too complicated since that's for the main Nginx config. `nodeginx`
is closest to this package in terms of functionality.
